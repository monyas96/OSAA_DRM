              <strong>Target: Reduce trade mispricing by 50%, recovering approximately $28 billion annually</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Trade-based IFFs represent the largest channel at roughly $57 billion annually. Reducing this by half requires transforming customs capacity, implementing transfer pricing transparency, and establishing beneficial ownership disclosure.
            </p>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Customs Capacity Transformation</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Customs authorities need advanced valuation training to identify suspicious invoicing patterns. Risk-based targeting systems must flag high-risk transactions for detailed examination. Pre-shipment inspection for extractive sector exports should verify quantities and qualities before goods leave ports. Regional benchmark price databases provide reference values for major commodities, making under-invoicing immediately visible.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Transfer Pricing Transparency</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Transfer pricing transparency requires country-by-country reporting from multinationals showing revenue, profit, employees, and taxes paid in each jurisdiction. Transfer pricing documentation requirements force companies to justify intra-group pricing. Regional information sharing allows tax authorities to compare declarations across countries and identify inconsistencies.
              </p>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Beneficial Ownership Disclosure</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Beneficial ownership disclosure establishes central registries identifying the natural persons who ultimately own and control companies. Cross-referencing trade with ownership data reveals when the same individuals control both exporting and importing entities, a common trade fraud structure. Public access to ownership information enables civil society and journalism to identify suspicious patterns.

              <strong>Target: Reduce corruption-related outflows by 60%</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Corruption enables and facilitates other IFF channels. Reducing corruption requires enforcement with consequences, procurement reform, and effective asset recovery.
            </p>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Enforcement with Consequences</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Enforcement must include high-level prosecutions demonstrating that no one is above the law. Mandatory asset declarations for public officials create baseline data for lifestyle audits that flag unexplained wealth. Whistleblower protection encourages reporting from inside corrupt networks. Each successful prosecution creates deterrence and signals political commitment.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Procurement Reform</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Procurement reform implements open contracting where all tender documents, bids, awards, and contracts are publicly accessible. Independent oversight bodies monitor major contracts. Digital platforms reduce opportunities for manipulation. Civil society monitoring provides external scrutiny. When procurement is transparent, corruption becomes visible and costly.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Asset Recovery</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Asset recovery requires dedicated units with forensic accountants and international cooperation networks. Non-conviction based forfeiture allows asset seizure even when criminal conviction proves difficult. Visible reuse of recovered assets—funding schools or hospitals—builds public support for anti-corruption efforts.

            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Criminal networks generate billions that must be laundered and moved offshore. Disruption requires strengthened financial intelligence, aggressive anti-money laundering enforcement, and regional cooperation.
            </p>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Strengthened Financial Intelligence</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Financial intelligence units need adequate resources—staff, technology, training—to analyze transaction patterns. Transaction monitoring systems should flag suspicious activity automatically. Banks and other financial institutions must file suspicious transaction reports knowing penalties for non-compliance are real. Regional intelligence sharing allows tracking of funds across borders.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Anti-Money Laundering Enforcement</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Anti-money laundering enforcement requires beneficial ownership information for all bank accounts, enhanced due diligence for high-risk transactions, and systems to detect trade-based money laundering where criminals manipulate trade invoices to move funds. Aggressive prosecution sends the message that laundering carries real consequences.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Regional Cooperation</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Regional cooperation enables joint operations targeting trafficking networks, intelligence sharing about routes and methods, coordinated border control to prevent smuggling, and extradition agreements ensuring criminals cannot escape to neighboring countries. Criminal networks operate regionally; the response must be equally coordinated.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-[#003366] mb-3">Strategic Priority 4: End Financial Secrecy</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              <strong>Target: All countries achieve transparency (Financial Secrecy Index below 40)</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Financial secrecy enables all other channels. Ending secrecy requires beneficial ownership transparency, automatic information exchange, country-by-country reporting, and sanctions on secrecy jurisdictions.
            </p>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Beneficial Ownership Transparency</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Beneficial ownership transparency means public central registries with no anonymous shell companies permitted. Verification of ownership information ensures accuracy. Real-time updates prevent companies from hiding behind outdated records. When every company's ownership is public, shell companies useful only for hiding wealth become worthless.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Automatic Information Exchange</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Automatic information exchange implements the OECD Common Reporting Standard where countries share tax information without requests. Tax information exchange with all jurisdictions closes gaps. Access to leak databases helps authorities identify offshore accounts.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Country-by-Country Reporting</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Country-by-country reporting requires multinationals to disclose revenue, profit, and tax per country publicly. This data enables transfer pricing audits by revealing where profits are declared relative to where economic activity occurs. A company showing huge profits in tax havens but losses where it actually operates faces scrutiny.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Sanctioning Secrecy Jurisdictions</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Sanctioning secrecy jurisdictions means identifying non-cooperative jurisdictions that refuse transparency. Withholding taxes on payments to tax havens reduces the benefit of profit shifting. Market access restrictions for financial institutions in secrecy jurisdictions create incentives for reform.

              <h4 className="font-bold text-[#003366] mb-2">Immediate Actions (0-24 months)</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Countries must launch high-profile prosecutions demonstrating political will to combat IFFs. Establishing beneficial ownership registries in at least 20 countries creates momentum and regional pressure. Implementing automatic tax information exchange begins closing offshore hiding spaces. Creating regional customs databases enables cross-border trade verification. Baseline IFF measurement establishes metrics for tracking progress.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                These immediate actions signal seriousness and create foundations for deeper reforms. Public prosecutions demonstrate consequences. Beneficial ownership registries make hiding more difficult. Information exchange closes offshore gaps. Each action reinforces the others.

              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Customs modernization should be complete with trained staff, risk-based systems, and regional databases operational. Universal beneficial ownership transparency becomes the norm with all countries maintaining public registries. Country-by-country reporting becomes operational, enabling systematic transfer pricing audits. Asset recovery units function effectively, successfully tracing and recovering stolen assets. Measurable IFF reduction of 20-30% demonstrates that the strategy is working.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                This phase consolidates early gains and builds sustainable systems. Customs can reliably detect trade fraud. Beneficial ownership makes hiding difficult. Transfer pricing audits catch profit shifting. Asset recovery creates tangible results. The 20-30% reduction proves the approach works.

              <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Trade mispricing should be reduced by 50% through effective customs capacity and transfer pricing enforcement. Corruption outflows reduced by 60% through sustained prosecution and procurement reform. Criminal networks disrupted through regional cooperation and financial intelligence. Universal transparency achieved with all countries maintaining Financial Secrecy Index below 40.

                The target is reducing total IFFs from $88.6 billion to $35-40 billion. This transforms the net flow calculation: $102 billion in minus $40 billion out equals $62 billion net benefit—a 360% increase from the current $13.4 billion.
