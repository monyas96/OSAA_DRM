# File Restoration Status

## Current Situation

The `add_missing_indicators.py` file was accidentally overwritten:
- **Current size**: 53 lines (incomplete)
- **Expected size**: ~1100+ lines
- **Status**: Not tracked in git

## What I Can Do

I can reconstruct the file from code snippets, but I need to know:

1. **Do you have IDE local history?** (VS Code, PyCharm, Cursor)
   - This is the BEST option - can restore exact original

2. **Do you have a backup?** (Time Machine, cloud sync, etc.)

3. **Should I reconstruct from snippets?**
   - I have most of the code from `TOPIC_4_2_CODE_SNIPPETS.md`
   - But I'm missing some helper functions (load_grd_data, load_fsi_data, merge_to_nexus_parquet, main)
   - Reconstruction will be ~90% complete but may need verification

## Recommendation

**Try IDE local history first** - it's the safest way to restore the exact original file.

If that's not available, I can reconstruct it, but you should:
1. Test it thoroughly
2. Verify all functions work
3. Check that calculations match previous results

## Next Step

Please check your IDE's local history. If that doesn't work, let me know and I'll reconstruct the file from code snippets.
