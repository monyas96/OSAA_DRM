              Africa moves from net capital exporter to net importer. The math changes fundamentally: $102 billion in minus $40 billion out equals $62 billion net benefit. Combined with tax system improvements from Brief 4.2 and capital market deepening from Brief 4.3, total domestic resource mobilization reaches $200-250 billion additional annually.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              This is not speculative—it represents retaining resources Africa already generates but currently loses. The infrastructure gap closes. Healthcare and education receive adequate funding. Climate adaptation is financed domestically. Africa finances its own transformation rather than depending on external support.

              Success means corruption is prosecuted with real consequences. Trade fraud is detected and penalized. Criminal networks face disruption. Transparency becomes normalized rather than exceptional. These institutional changes rebuild trust—between citizens and government, between businesses and tax authorities, between Africa and international partners.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Strong institutions create virtuous cycles. Successful prosecutions deter future corruption. Effective customs make trade fraud unprofitable. Transparency makes hiding wealth difficult. Each success makes the next one easier.

            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Reduced aid dependency means policy autonomy without donor conditions. Wealth staying domestic means resources controlled by Africans for African priorities. The continent achieves self-determination—the ability to chart its own development path.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Economic sovereignty is not isolation but empowerment. Countries engage with the global economy from positions of strength rather than desperation. Aid becomes partnership rather than necessity. Investment flows respond to opportunity rather than filling gaps created by hemorrhaging resources.

              The reverse flow completes the four-part resource mobilization story. Brief 4.1 addressed the value leak through efficiency losses in spending. Brief 4.2 tackled the collection leak with $120-145 billion in tax revenue lost. Brief 4.3 examined the capital drain as savings flow abroad from shallow markets. Brief 4.4 addresses the reverse flow—$88.6 billion stolen through illicit channels.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              <strong>Total resource loss across all four briefs: $200-300+ billion annually.</strong>

            <p className="text-sm text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Africa doesn't have a resource scarcity problem—it has a resource hemorrhage problem. The continent generates sufficient revenue, savings, and economic activity, but weak institutions create four simultaneous leaks. The solution requires plugging all four leaks simultaneously: make spending efficient, strengthen tax collection, deepen capital markets, and stop illicit flows.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Stopping the reverse flow alone would retain $50+ billion annually—nearly equal to all development aid. Combined with other domestic resource mobilization improvements, Africa would mobilize $200-250 billion additional annually—enough to finance transformation without external dependency.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
              The question is not whether Africa has the resources. The question is whether Africa will build the institutions to keep them.
